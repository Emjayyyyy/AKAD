#-----DETAILS-----

#Write a function called sumIntervals/sum_intervals() that accepts an array of intervals, and returns the sum of all the interval lengths. Overlapping intervals should only be counted once.

#Intervals
#Intervals are represented by a pair of integers in the form of an array. The first value of the interval will always be less than the second value. Interval example: [1, 5] is an interval from 1 to 5. The length of this interval is 4.



#-----SOLUTION------

def sum_of_intervals(intervals):
    return_lst = []
    for element in intervals:
        return_lst.extend(list(range(element[0],element[1])))
    return len(set(return_lst))
