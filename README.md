# KATA
A Kata A Day

This repository contains a collection of daily "KATA"s I complete.

A "KATA" is nothing but a challenge for you to complete, all of them are from codewars.com.
Codewars is a site to practise and improve your programming and problem solving skills by completeing challenges or KATAs. There are several languages you can choose to code in, this repository will mostly be filled with Python challenges as currently I wish to enhance my Python skills.
