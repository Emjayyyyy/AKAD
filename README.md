# KATA
This repository contains a collection of "KATA"s which I have completed.

A "KATA" is nothing but a challenge for you to complete, in the website codewars.com.

Codewars is a site to practise and improve your programming and problem solving skills by completeing challenges or KATAs. There are several languages you can choose to code in, this repository will mostly be filled with Python challenges.
