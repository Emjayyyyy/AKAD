# KATA

This repository contains a collection of __KATAs__ which I have completed.

A __"KATA"__ is nothing but a challenge for you to complete, taken from the website *codewars.com*

__Codewars__ is a site to practise and improve your programming and problem solving skills by completeing challenges or __KATAs__. There are several languages you can choose to code in, this repository will mostly be filled with __Python__ challenges.
