#-----DETAILS-----

#Your task in order to complete this Kata is to write a function which formats a duration, given as a number of seconds, in a human-friendly way.

#The function must accept a non-negative integer. If it is zero, it just returns "now". Otherwise, the duration is expressed as a combination of years, days, hours, minutes and seconds.

#It is much easier to understand with an example:

#* For seconds = 62, your function should return 
#    "1 minute and 2 seconds"
#* For seconds = 3662, your function should return
#    "1 hour, 1 minute and 2 seconds"
#For the purpose of this Kata, a year is 365 days and a day is 24 hours.

#Note that spaces are important.


#-----SOLUTION------

def format_duration(seconds):
    
    if not seconds:
        return 'now'
    
    m,s = divmod(seconds,60)
    h,m = divmod(m,60)
    d,h = divmod(h,24)
    y,d = divmod(d,365)
    
    time = [y,d,h,m,s]
    
    words = ["year", "day", "hour", "minute", "second"]
    
    duration = []
    
    for i,t in enumerate(time):
        if t == 1:
            duration.append(f"{t} {words[i]}")
        elif t > 1:
            duration.append(f"{t} {words[i]}s")
            
    
    return ', '.join(duration[:-1]) + ' and ' + duration[-1] if len(duration) > 1 else duration[0]
